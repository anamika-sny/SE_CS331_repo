Project Scope

This project focuses on understanding the working of a SOAR system in a computer security environment. The scope of the project includes studying security incidents, analyzing how alerts are generated by different security tools, and designing automated workflows to handle such incidents in an efficient manner.

Motivation

Organizations receive a large number of security alerts every day. Handling these alerts manually requires time and effort and may lead to delays in response. This project is motivated by the need to reduce manual work and improve the speed and accuracy of security incident response using automation.

System Functionality

The SOAR system collects alerts from multiple security sources, processes and analyzes them, and creates security incidents. Based on predefined rules and workflows, the system can automatically perform response actions or request approval from a security analyst before taking critical actions.

Security and Access Control

The system ensures secure access by allowing only authorized users to perform actions. Role-based access control is used to restrict user permissions, and all activities are logged for accountability.

Expected Outcomes

The expected outcome of this project is faster incident response, reduced manual workload, and improved consistency in handling security incidents. The system also helps in maintaining proper records for auditing and reporting purposes.
