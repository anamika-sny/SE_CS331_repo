This project focuses on Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) in the field of computer security.
The project aims to study and design a system that can automatically detect, analyze, and respond to security incidents.
The system collects security alerts from multiple tools such as SIEM, IDS/IPS, firewalls, and endpoint protection systems.
Collected alerts are normalized, correlated, and converted into security incidents with defined life-cycle states.
Automated response playbooks are executed to handle common security incidents and reduce manual effort.
Manual approval is required for critical response actions to ensure safe and controlled operations.
The system improves incident response time, increases operational efficiency, and supports secure and consistent security operations.
